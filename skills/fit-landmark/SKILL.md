  Demonstrate engineering progress without making individuals feel
  surveilled, and find growth areas backed by evidence. Use when the
  quarterly review has only ticket counts and you need system-level
  trends, when checking promotion readiness, when assessing whether
  culture investments are working, or when exploring GetDX snapshot
  trends, marker evidence, engineer voice, and growth timelines.

# Landmark

Analysis and recommendation layer on top of Map data. Landmark reads from Map's
activity schema and standard YAML to surface evidence, health, readiness, growth
timelines, and engineer voice. Evidence rows are written by Guide's evaluation
pipeline; all Landmark computation is deterministic — no LLM calls.

## When to Use

**Demonstrate engineering progress:**

- Showing system-level trends — `npx fit-landmark health --manager <email>`
- Assessing whether culture investments are working — `npx fit-landmark snapshot trend --item <id>`
- Exploring GetDX snapshot trends and comparisons — `npx fit-landmark snapshot compare`

**Find growth areas backed by evidence:**

- Checking promotion readiness — `npx fit-landmark readiness --email <email>`
- Viewing growth timelines — `npx fit-landmark timeline --email <email>`
- Comparing evidenced vs derived capability — `npx fit-landmark practiced --manager <email>`

**Surface engineer voice:**

- Surfacing feedback from GetDX comments — `npx fit-landmark voice --manager <email>`
- Viewing an individual's voice — `npx fit-landmark voice --email <email>`

## How It Works

### Evidence Model

Landmark combines two data sources: **standard data** (YAML definitions from Map
with skill markers and proficiency levels) and **activity data** (GetDX
snapshots, GitHub artifacts, and Guide-interpreted evidence stored in the Map
activity schema). Evidence is linked to skills via marker definitions authored
in capability YAML files.

### Readiness Assessment

Promotion readiness compares an engineer's evidenced skill levels against the
marker checklist for their target level. Each marker is checked against
available evidence — the result is a per-skill pass/gap report showing what has
been demonstrated and what still needs demonstration.

### Health Analysis

Team health aggregates GetDX driver scores, skill evidence coverage, and growth
trajectory across a manager's reports. The health view combines quantitative
snapshot data with qualitative evidence to surface where teams are strong and
where they need support.

### Privacy Model

Each view applies privacy rules based on the audience — engineers see only their
own data, managers see their direct reports, directors see aggregated team
data.

## CLI Reference

See [`references/cli.md`](references/cli.md) for full command listings.

---

## Audience Model

Each view applies privacy rules based on the audience:

- **Engineer** (own data): `evidence`, `readiness`, `timeline`, `coverage`,
  `voice --email`
- **Manager** (1:1 tool): `health`, `readiness`, `timeline`, `practiced`,
  `voice --manager`
- **Director** (planning): `snapshot`, `coverage`, `practiced`,
  `voice --manager`

## Common Workflows

See [`references/workflows.md`](references/workflows.md) for worked examples.

---

## Prerequisites

- GetDX account with API access
- Map activity schema migrated and populated (`npx fit-map activity migrate`)
- Standard data with drivers and markers authored in capability YAML
- Summit (optional) for inline growth recommendations in health view

## Verification

```sh
npx fit-landmark org show                # Should display organization directory
npx fit-landmark snapshot list           # Should list available GetDX snapshots
npx fit-landmark health                  # Should display team health overview
```
