name: fit-eval
description: >
  Drive a single agent, run a supervisor–agent relay, or facilitate a
  multi-agent session — and capture every turn as an NDJSON trace. Use for
  agent evaluations (pass/fail verdicts) or agent collaboration (specialists
  coordinating in one session). Pair with `fit-trace` for analysis.

# fit-eval

`fit-eval` is the plumbing for running agents and capturing what they did. It
orchestrates the run; `fit-trace` analyzes what happened. The boundary between
the two is a single NDJSON trace file.

The same plumbing serves two parallel use cases.

## Two Use Cases

### 1. Agent evaluations

A **judge agent** observes a **target agent** via `fit-eval supervise`. The
judge signals the verdict by calling `Conclude`; the exit code (`0` pass, `1`
fail) makes the eval surface as a regular CI check. The trace captures the
full session for inspection. (In CLI flag names, *supervisor* = judge,
*agent* = target.)

### 2. Agent collaboration

A **facilitator** coordinates **N participant agents** via `fit-eval
facilitate`. Participants and the facilitator pass targeted messages with
`Ask`/`Answer` and broadcast with `Announce`; the facilitator ends the
session with `Conclude`. The trace records every message and tool call.

→ [Agent Collaboration guide](https://www.forwardimpact.team/docs/guides/agent-collaboration/index.md)

`run` is the autonomous building block under both — a single agent on a
defined task, no supervisor or facilitator.

## Modes at a Glance

| Mode         | Shape                              | Pick when                                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run`        | One agent, autonomous              | Task is well-scoped and you trust the agent to finish unattended |
| `supervise`  | Supervisor + agent, relay loop     | A second model should observe and intervene during the run       |
| `facilitate` | Facilitator + N participants, message bus | The work needs multiple specialists coordinating in one session  |

## CLI

Install and run via npm:

```sh
npx fit-eval <command> [options]
```

The full flag surface — execution commands, shared options, mode-specific
options, and output commands — lives in [references/cli.md](references/cli.md).

## Orchestration Tools

In `supervise` and `facilitate` modes, agents coordinate via tool calls
instead of free-form chat. The same tools serve both use cases — verdict
signaling for evaluations, message passing for collaboration. The trace
records each call.

| Tool       | Caller                          | Effect                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ask`      | Any                             | Send a question to a target; reply arrives via `Answer` |
| `Answer`   | Agent / participant             | Reply to an `Ask` addressed to you                      |
| `Announce` | Any                             | Broadcast a message with no reply expected              |
| `Conclude` | Supervisor / facilitator        | End the session with a final summary                    |
| `Redirect` | Supervisor (supervise mode)     | Interrupt the agent with replacement instructions       |
| `RollCall` | Any                             | List the participants currently in the session          |

Tool surface differs by role: supervisors use `Ask`/`Announce`/`Conclude`/`Redirect`/`RollCall`; supervised agents use `Ask`/`Answer`/`Announce`/`RollCall`; facilitators use `Ask`/`Announce`/`Conclude`/`RollCall` (no `Redirect` — the facilitator re-`Ask`s instead); facilitated participants use `Ask`/`Answer`/`Announce`/`RollCall`.

## Typical Workflow

```sh
# 1. Run an agent and save the trace
npx fit-eval run \
  --task-file task.md \
  --model opus \
  --output trace.ndjson

# 2. Read the trace as text for a quick sanity check
npx fit-eval output --format=text < trace.ndjson

# 3. Hand off to fit-trace for structured analysis
npx fit-trace overview trace.ndjson
```

For a supervised run, swap `run` for `supervise` and add a supervisor profile:

```sh
npx fit-eval supervise \
  --task-file task.md \
  --supervisor-profile reviewer \
  --agent-profile coder \
  --output trace.ndjson
```

For a multi-agent session, use `facilitate` and list the participants:

```sh
npx fit-eval facilitate \
  --task-file task.md \
  --agent-profiles "security-engineer,technical-writer" \
  --output trace.ndjson
```

---

## Handing Off to `fit-trace`

Every `fit-eval` execution command produces NDJSON. Once it's on disk, the
work shifts from running to understanding — that's where `fit-trace` takes
over. Use `fit-trace overview`, `timeline`, `search`, `errors`, and
`stats` against the same file to study what the agent did and why.

The `fit-eval` skill stops at the trace file. The `fit-trace` skill picks up
from there.
