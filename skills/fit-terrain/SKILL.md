# fit-terrain CLI

Generate synthetic data for the entire Forward Impact suite from a single DSL
file. The CLI orchestrates parsing, entity generation, optional LLM prose, and
rendering into multiple output formats.

## When to Use

**Generate eval datasets and test data:**

- Building from cached prose (no LLM needed) — `npx fit-terrain build`
- Regenerating prose with an LLM — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... npx fit-terrain generate`
- Validating a terrain DSL file — `npx fit-terrain check`

**Bootstrap a realistic environment:**

- Creating synthetic engineering standards for new installations
- Producing organizational documents, activity records, and KB content
- Testing pipeline changes end-to-end with synthetic data

**Build a healthcare deployment:**

- Declaring trials, sites, and conditions in a `clinical {}` DSL block
- Generating Synthea-backed patient cohorts filtered to those conditions
- Rendering patient-facing prose and Schema.org `MedicalCondition` /
  `MedicalTrial` / `MedicalClinic` microdata pages

## How It Works

### Pipeline

Generation flows through four stages:

1. **DSL parsing** — the terrain file is parsed into an AST containing the
   org hierarchy, people, projects, engineering-standard definitions, content
   specs, and optionally a `clinical {}` domain (conditions, sites, trials,
   criteria, content keys).
2. **Entity generation** — the AST is expanded deterministically (seeded RNG)
   into a full entity graph: orgs, departments, teams, people, repos,
   projects, and — when `clinical {}` is present — conditions, sites, trials,
   criteria, and researchers with bidirectional cross-references.
3. **Prose generation** — prose keys are collected (one per article, FAQ,
   briefing, condition explainer, trial FAQ, etc.) with context (topic, tone,
   length). The `build` verb reads from `prose-cache.json`; `generate` sends
   each key to an LLM and writes the result back to the cache before
   building. Clinical prose uses a medical-communications system prompt.
4. **Rendering** — entities and prose render into YAML standard files
   (`pathway`), HTML articles + clinical pages with Schema.org microdata
   (`html`), JSON/YAML activity records (`raw`), Markdown briefings
   (`markdown`). External `dataset` blocks emit through `output` blocks to
   formats including JSON, CSV, Parquet, SQL, `supabase_migration`, and
   `embeddings_jsonl`.

### Content Validation

After rendering, cross-content validation runs automatically: internal HTML
links are checked for resolution, entities referenced in prose are verified
against the entity graph, and rendered YAML is validated against pathway
schemas.

### Prose Caching

The prose cache maps each content key to its generated text. `build` reads
from the cache (no LLM calls). `generate` regenerates entries and writes the
updated cache, then runs the same render+write as `build`.

Structured pathway entities use a stable cache key derived from the entity
key alone (e.g. `pathway:track:platform`), so prompt changes (such as
preamble updates) do not invalidate existing entries — use `generate` to
refresh them. General prose entries (articles, comments, briefings) use a
cache key that includes the content context (topic, tone, length).

### Output Cleanup

The CLI cleans output directories before writing new files, preventing stale
files from prior runs from persisting. This means each run produces a clean,
complete output set.

## CLI Reference

See [`references/cli.md`](references/cli.md) for full command listings.

---

## Terrain DSL

See [`references/dsl.md`](references/dsl.md) for syntax, top-level blocks, and
key block descriptions.

---

## Data Resolution

Use `--story=path` to specify a custom terrain DSL file. Without `--story`, the
CLI falls back to the minimal reference DSL bundled with the package.

Generated output writes to the `data/` directories listed under Content Types
above.

---

## Prose Cache

The prose cache is stored at `data/synthetic/prose-cache.json`. This file is
pre-populated for the BioNova terrain. The default mode reads from it without
LLM calls.

`fit-terrain generate` regenerates prose and writes the cache after generation
completes. To do a full regeneration, delete the cache file first and run
`fit-terrain generate`.

---

## Dataset Blocks

See [`references/datasets.md`](references/datasets.md) for external tool
requirements.

---

## Environment

The `generate` verb requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`:

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key> npx fit-terrain generate
```

The `check`, `validate`, and `build` verbs require no LLM credentials — they
read from the prose cache.

DSL files that declare a Synthea `dataset` block also need Java 11+ on
`PATH` and the Synthea JAR available via `SYNTHEA_JAR` (or in the default
`vendor/synthea/synthea-with-dependencies.jar` location). When either is
missing the pipeline logs an "unavailable" line and skips the Synthea block
— it does not fail the run. See
[`references/datasets.md`](references/datasets.md) for the one-time install.

---

## Logging

Set `DEBUG=terrain` for verbose debug output during generation. Operational
progress is logged to stderr via libtelemetry Logger (RFC 5424 format with
timestamps). Stdout is reserved for file counts, validation results, and prose
cache statistics.

---

## Feeding Generated Content to Guide

After generation, bootstrap the full Guide pipeline:

```sh
npx fit-process-resources   # Create resource index from knowledge files
npx fit-process-graphs      # Build RDF graph from resources
npx fit-process-vectors     # Generate vector embeddings (requires TEI)
npx fit-rc start            # Start services
npx fit-guide               # Verify end-to-end
```

## Verification

After generation, the CLI runs cross-content validation automatically and
reports pass/fail for each check. Validate the generated pathway data
separately:

```sh
npx fit-map validate
```
