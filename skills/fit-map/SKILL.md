  Define what good engineering looks like — author and validate agent-aligned engineering standard
  definitions for skills, capabilities, behaviours, disciplines, tracks,

# Map Product

A public data model for consumption by AI agents and engineers. Map is the
foundation of all Forward Impact products — it defines how engineering
competencies, career progression, and agent capabilities are structured in a
machine-readable format. Map ships two layers: a **standard layer** (YAML files
validated against JSON Schema and RDF/SHACL) and an **activity layer** (a
Supabase project with `organization_people`, GitHub artifacts, GetDX snapshots,
and marker evidence).

Making the data model well understood is a first-class goal. It is published in
structured formats (JSON Schema, RDF/SHACL) so that AI agents can reliably
interpret and work with agent-aligned engineering standard data.

## When to Use

**Agent-Aligned Engineering Standard-layer validation and inspection:**

- Validating standard data integrity after changes
- Checking data summary (skill counts, entity counts)
- Generating browser index files for the web app
- Exporting base entities to HTML microdata
- Understanding what entities exist in the data

**Agent-Aligned Engineering Standard-layer authoring and schema work:**

- Defining or tailoring engineering expectations for your organization
- Adding or modifying skills in capability files
- Adding new behaviours, disciplines, tracks, or levels
- Adding interview questions
- Working with JSON Schema or RDF/SHACL definitions
- Improving schema documentation for public consumption

**Activity-layer operations:**

- Starting, stopping, and checking the local Supabase stack
- Applying activity-schema migrations
- Validating a people roster against the agent-aligned engineering standard
- Pushing a people roster into `activity.organization_people`
- Syncing GetDX snapshots into the activity database
- Reprocessing the `raw` bucket after a transform fix or backfill
- Verifying the activity database is populated and reachable

## How It Works

### Data Loading

Map loads YAML files from structured directories (`disciplines/`, `tracks/`,
`capabilities/`, `behaviours/`, `levels.yaml`, etc.). Skills are extracted from
capability files during loading — they live inside capabilities rather than as
standalone files. The result is a unified data object containing all entities
with their cross-references resolved by ID.

### Validation Pipeline

Validation runs in two phases:

1. **Schema validation** — each YAML file is checked against its corresponding
   JSON Schema (e.g. capability files against `capability.schema.json`). This
   catches structural issues like missing required fields or wrong types.
2. **Referential integrity** — after schema passes, cross-references are
   verified: skill IDs referenced by disciplines must exist in capabilities,
   behaviour IDs in tracks must exist, track IDs in discipline `validTracks`
   must exist, driver `contributingSkills` and `contributingBehaviours` must
   point to valid entities, and level references (`minLevel`) must resolve.

### Index Generation

The index generator creates `_index.yaml` files in each entity directory,
listing all valid file IDs. These indexes enable browser-based discovery without
filesystem access — the web app loads them to know which entities are available.

## CLI Reference

See [`references/cli.md`](references/cli.md) for full command listings.

### Edge functions (hosted-only)

Four edge functions ship in the bundled Supabase project and deploy with
`supabase functions deploy`:

| Function         | Trigger                                    | Responsibility                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `github-webhook` | POST from a configured GitHub webhook      | Store raw payload + upsert `github_events`, `github_artifacts` with email resolution  |
| `people-upload`  | POST with a CSV/YAML body                  | Store raw upload + upsert `organization_people` (equivalent to `fit-map people push`) |
| `getdx-sync`     | Scheduled POST (cron, GitHub Actions, etc) | Fetch + store + transform GetDX (equivalent to `fit-map getdx sync`)                  |
| `transform`      | On-demand POST                             | Reprocess the `raw` bucket end-to-end (equivalent to `fit-map activity transform`)    |

Every edge function returns a JSON response with per-target counts and errors.

## Data Structure

```
data/pathway/
├── standard.yaml         # Standard metadata, entity definitions
├── levels.yaml            # Career levels (J040, J060, etc.)
├── stages.yaml            # Lifecycle stages (plan, code, review, etc.)
├── drivers.yaml           # Organizational outcomes
├── disciplines/           # Engineering specialties (software_engineering, etc.)
├── tracks/                # Work contexts (platform, forward_deployed, etc.)
├── behaviours/            # Approach to work (outcome_ownership, etc.)
├── capabilities/          # Skills grouped by area (delivery, scale, etc.)
├── repository/            # Repository configuration (vscode-settings, devcontainer, etc.)
└── questions/             # Interview questions
    ├── skills/            # Per-skill question sets
    └── behaviours/        # Per-behaviour question sets
```

Entity files use **co-located content** — `human:` and `agent:` sections in the
same YAML file. All entities have an `id` field used for cross-references.

## Schema Definitions and Common Tasks

See [`references/tasks.md`](references/tasks.md) for schema locations and
authoring tasks.

## Verification

Always run validation after changes:

```sh
npx fit-map validate
```
