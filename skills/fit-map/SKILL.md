# Map Product

A public data model for consumption by AI agents and engineers. Map is the
foundation of all Forward Impact products — it defines how engineering
competencies, career progression, and agent capabilities are structured in a
machine-readable format.

Making the data model well understood is a first-class goal. It is published in
structured formats (JSON Schema, RDF/SHACL) so that AI agents can reliably
interpret and work with career framework data.

## When to Use

**Data validation and inspection:**

- Validating framework data integrity after changes
- Checking data summary (skill counts, entity counts)
- Generating browser index files for the web app
- Understanding what entities exist in the data

**Data authoring and schema work:**

- Adding or modifying skills in capability files
- Adding new behaviours, disciplines, tracks, or levels
- Adding interview questions
- Working with JSON Schema or RDF/SHACL definitions
- Improving schema documentation for public consumption

## How It Works

### Data Loading

Map loads YAML files from structured directories (`disciplines/`, `tracks/`,
`capabilities/`, `behaviours/`, `levels.yaml`, etc.). Skills are extracted from
capability files during loading — they live inside capabilities rather than as
standalone files. The result is a unified data object containing all entities
with their cross-references resolved by ID.

### Validation Pipeline

Validation runs in two phases:

1. **Schema validation** — each YAML file is checked against its corresponding
   JSON Schema (e.g. capability files against `capability.schema.json`). This
   catches structural issues like missing required fields or wrong types.
2. **Referential integrity** — after schema passes, cross-references are
   verified: skill IDs referenced by disciplines must exist in capabilities,
   behaviour IDs in tracks must exist, track IDs in discipline `validTracks`
   must exist, driver `contributingSkills` and `contributingBehaviours` must
   point to valid entities, and level references (`minLevel`) must resolve.

### Index Generation

The index generator creates `_index.yaml` files in each entity directory,
listing all valid file IDs. These indexes enable browser-based discovery
without filesystem access — the web app loads them to know which entities are
available.

## CLI

```sh
npx fit-map validate                    # Validate all data (JSON schema + referential)
npx fit-map validate --shacl            # Validate RDF/SHACL syntax
npx fit-map validate --data=PATH        # Validate a specific data directory
npx fit-map generate-index              # Generate _index.yaml files for browser loading
npx fit-map people import <file>        # Import people from CSV/YAML (validates against framework)
npx fit-map people import <f> --data=P  # Import with custom data directory
```

Validation output includes a data summary showing entity counts. Use this to
quickly verify data is loading correctly after changes.

## Data Structure

```
data/pathway/
├── framework.yaml         # Framework metadata, entity definitions
├── levels.yaml            # Career levels (J040, J060, etc.)
├── stages.yaml            # Lifecycle stages (plan, code, review, etc.)
├── drivers.yaml           # Organizational outcomes
├── disciplines/           # Engineering specialties (software_engineering, etc.)
├── tracks/                # Work contexts (platform, forward_deployed, etc.)
├── behaviours/            # Approach to work (outcome_ownership, etc.)
├── capabilities/          # Skills grouped by area (delivery, scale, etc.)
├── repository/            # Repository configuration (vscode-settings, devcontainer, etc.)
└── questions/             # Interview questions
    ├── skills/            # Per-skill question sets
    └── behaviours/        # Per-behaviour question sets
```

Entity files use **co-located content** — `human:` and `agent:` sections in the
same YAML file. All entities have an `id` field used for cross-references.

---

## Schema Definitions

### JSON Schema (`schema/json/`)

Validates YAML structure. One schema per entity type.

### RDF/SHACL (`schema/rdf/`)

Semantic representation for linked data interoperability.

**Schema synchronization:** When adding or modifying properties, update both
`schema/json/` and `schema/rdf/` in the same commit. The two formats must stay
in sync.

## Common Tasks

### Add a Skill

1. Add skill to capability file:
   `data/pathway/capabilities/{capability_id}.yaml`
2. Add skill object with `id`, `name`, and `human:` section
3. Include level descriptions for all five proficiency levels
4. Reference skill in disciplines (coreSkills/supportingSkills/broadSkills)
5. Add questions: `data/pathway/questions/skills/{skill_id}.yaml`
6. Optionally add `agent:` section for AI coding agent support
7. Run `npx fit-map validate`

### Add Interview Questions

Location:

- Skills: `data/pathway/questions/skills/{skill_id}.yaml`
- Behaviours: `data/pathway/questions/behaviours/{behaviour_id}.yaml`

Required properties:

| Property     | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | Format: `{abbrev}_{level_abbrev}_{number}`     |
| `text`       | Question text (second person, under 150 chars) |
| `lookingFor` | 2-4 bullet points of good answer indicators    |

### Add Agent Skill Section

Add `agent:` section to skill in capability file:

```yaml
agent:
  name: skill-name-kebab-case
  description: Brief description
  useWhen: When agents should apply this skill
  stages:
    plan:
      focus: Planning objectives
      activities: [...]
      ready: [...]
    code:
      focus: Implementation objectives
      activities: [...]
      ready: [...]
```

### Add Tool Reference

Add `toolReferences:` to skill in capability file:

```yaml
toolReferences:
  - name: Langfuse
    url: https://langfuse.com/docs
    description: LLM observability platform
    useWhen: Instrumenting AI applications
```

## Verification

Always run validation after changes:

```sh
npx fit-map validate
```
