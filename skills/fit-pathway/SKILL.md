  See what's expected at your level, configure agents to meet your
  organization's engineering standard, and make staffing decisions you can
  defend. Use when expectations are unclear and you need role definitions
  by discipline, track, and level, when agents follow generic practices
  instead of your standard, when analyzing career progression gaps, or
  when generating job definitions, interview questions, or a published
  engineering standard site.

# Pathway Package

Web application, CLI, and formatters for career progression, job definitions,
and agent profile generation. Two audiences use `fit-pathway` differently:

| Audience          | Goal                                                             | How they run it                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Organizations** | Publish a agent-aligned engineering standard for their engineers | `npx fit-pathway build` in a standalone project |
| **Engineers**     | Explore jobs, skills, and career progression                     | `npx fit-pathway` installed in their project    |

## When to Use

**Understand what's expected at your level:**

- Looking up role expectations — `npx fit-pathway job <discipline> <level>`
- Understanding proficiency and autonomy at each level — `npx fit-pathway level <id>`
- Analyzing career progression gaps — `npx fit-pathway progress <discipline> <level> --compare=<target>`
- Exploring skills, behaviours, and drivers — `npx fit-pathway skill <id>`, `npx fit-pathway behaviour <id>`

**Configure agents to meet your engineering standard:**

- Generating agent configurations — `npx fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track> --output=./agents`
- Previewing what an agent profile includes — `npx fit-pathway agent <discipline> --track=<track>`

**Make staffing decisions you can defend:**

- Generating or comparing job definitions — `npx fit-pathway job <discipline> <level> --track=<track>`
- Selecting interview questions for a role — `npx fit-pathway interview <discipline> <level>`

**Publish and maintain your engineering standard:**

- Setting up a standard project — `npx fit-map init`
- Building a static site — `npx fit-pathway build`
- Previewing changes — `npx fit-pathway dev`

## How It Works

### Job Derivation

A job is derived in real-time from three inputs: **discipline**, **level**, and
optionally **track**. For each skill in the discipline:

1. The skill's tier in the discipline — core, supporting, or broad
2. The level's base proficiency for that tier sets the starting point (e.g.
   "foundational" for core skills at J060)
3. Track modifiers shift proficiency up or down **per capability** — a platform
   track with `scale: +1` raises all skills in the scale capability by one
   level, while `delivery: -1` lowers delivery skills
4. Positive modifiers are capped at the level's maximum base proficiency;
   results are clamped to the valid range (awareness → expert)

Behaviours follow the same pattern: base maturity from the level, then
discipline and track modifiers stacked and clamped.

Skills from capabilities the track modifies positively — but that aren't in the
base discipline — are added as broad-type "track-added" skills.

### Agent Derivation

Agent profiles reuse job derivation with three additions:

1. **Reference level** is auto-selected — the first level where core skills
   reach "practitioner", falling back to "working", then the middle level
2. **Skill filtering** removes `isHumanOnly` skills (physical presence,
   emotional judgment)
3. **Skill focusing** limits the matrix to the most relevant skills per stage,
   sorted by tier (core → supporting → broad → track-added)

Working styles are derived from the top behaviours by maturity — behaviours with
positive track modifiers become personality traits that shape the agent's
approach.

### Tool Derivation

Tools come from `toolReferences` in skill definitions. Derivation collects all
tool references from the job's highest-proficiency skills, deduplicates by name,
and sorts alphabetically. Each tool tracks which skills reference it.

### Interview Questions

Questions are selected from question banks organized by skill/behaviour ID, role
type, and proficiency/maturity. Three interview types exist: mission fit (skill
questions), decomposition (capability questions), and stakeholder simulation
(behaviour questions). Selection prioritizes by skill type and fills a time
budget.

### Career Progression

Progression compares two job derivations (current vs target level) and
calculates deltas — skill proficiency changes, gained/lost skills, and behaviour
maturity changes.

## Discovery Workflows

See [`references/workflows.md`](references/workflows.md) for exploration
patterns and worked examples.

## CLI Reference

See [`references/cli.md`](references/cli.md) for full command listings.

## Data Resolution

The CLI resolves the data directory in this order:

1. `--data=<path>` flag (explicit override)
2. Upward traversal from CWD — looks for `data/` (up to 3 parents)
3. `~/.fit/data/` (user-global fallback)

Use `npx fit-map init` to create a local `./data/` directory with starter
standard data to get started.

## Build and Serve

```sh
npx fit-pathway build                            # Static site to public/
npx fit-pathway build --url=https://example.com  # With distribution packs
npx fit-pathway serve                            # Serve public/ (port 3000)
npx fit-pathway serve ./dist --port=8080         # Custom dir and port
```

`serve` enables git smart HTTP so `apm install` (which uses
`git clone --depth=1`) works against the pack repos.

## Verification

```sh
npx fit-map validate    # Validate data files after changes
npx fit-pathway dev     # Preview changes in browser
```
