  Synthetic data generation CLI. Generates framework definitions, organizational
  documents, activity data, and personal knowledge base content from a universe
  DSL file. Use when generating example data, testing with synthetic datasets,
  or working with the universe DSL.

# fit-universe CLI

Generate synthetic data for the entire Forward Impact suite from a single DSL
file. The CLI orchestrates parsing, entity generation, optional LLM prose, and
rendering into multiple output formats.

## When to Use

- Generating example data for development or testing
- Creating synthetic pathway frameworks for new installations
- Producing organizational documents, activity records, and KB content
- Testing pipeline changes end-to-end
- Writing or editing universe DSL files

---

## How It Works

### Pipeline

Generation flows through four stages:

1. **DSL parsing** — the universe file is tokenized and parsed into an AST
   containing organizational hierarchy, people, projects, framework
   definitions, and content specifications
2. **Entity generation** — the AST is expanded deterministically (using a
   seeded RNG) into a full entity graph: orgs, departments, teams, people with
   roles and skill assignments, repos, and projects
3. **Prose generation** — prose keys are collected from the entity graph (one
   per article, FAQ, briefing, etc.) with context (topic, tone, length). By
   default these are read from `.prose-cache.json`; with `--generate` each
   key is sent to an LLM and the result saved to the cache; with `--no-prose`
   this stage is skipped entirely
4. **Rendering** — entities and prose are rendered into output formats: YAML
   framework files (`pathway`), HTML articles (`html`), JSON/YAML activity
   records (`raw`), and Markdown briefings (`markdown`)

### Content Validation

After rendering, cross-content validation runs automatically: internal HTML
links are checked for resolution, entities referenced in prose are verified
against the entity graph, and rendered YAML is validated against pathway
schemas.

### Prose Caching

The prose cache maps each content key to its generated text. The default mode
reads from the cache, making generation fully repeatable without LLM calls.
Using `--generate` appends new entries to the cache, so subsequent default
runs include all previously generated content.

---

## CLI Reference

```sh
npx fit-universe                     # Use cached prose (default, repeatable)
npx fit-universe --generate          # Generate prose via LLM (requires LLM_TOKEN)
npx fit-universe --no-prose          # Structural scaffolding only (no prose at all)
npx fit-universe --strict            # Fail on cache miss (with default cached mode)
npx fit-universe --load              # Load raw docs to Supabase Storage
npx fit-universe --only=pathway      # Render only one content type
npx fit-universe --dry-run           # Show what would be written
npx fit-universe --universe=path     # Custom universe file
```

### Content Types

Use `--only=<type>` to generate a single content type:

| Type       | Output Directory | Contents                        |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `html`     | `data/knowledge` | Articles, guides, FAQs, courses |
| `pathway`  | `data/pathway`   | YAML framework files            |
| `raw`      | `data/activity`  | Roster, GitHub events, evidence |
| `markdown` | `data/personal`  | Briefings, notes, KB content    |

### Prose Modes

| Mode       | Flag         | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `cached`   | _(default)_  | Read from `.prose-cache.json` (no LLM needed)  |
| `generate` | `--generate` | Call LLM, write new entries to cache            |
| `no-prose` | `--no-prose` | Structural scaffolding only, no prose at all    |

## Universe DSL

Universe files define a complete synthetic environment. This monorepo's universe
DSL is at `examples/universe.dsl`. A minimal reference DSL ships with
libsyntheticgen at `libraries/libsyntheticgen/data/default.dsl` for quick
testing; projects provide their own DSL file.

### Top-Level Blocks

```dsl
universe Name {
  domain "example.dev"
  industry "technology"
  seed 42

  org hq { ... }
  department engineering { ... }
  team backend { ... }
  people { ... }
  project alpha { ... }
  snapshots { ... }
  scenario launch_push { ... }
  framework { ... }
  content guide_html { ... }
  content basecamp_markdown { ... }
}
```

### Key Blocks

**org / department / team** — Organizational hierarchy with headcounts,
managers, and repo assignments.

**people** — Count, name theme, level distribution, discipline distribution.

**project** — Cross-team initiatives with timelines and prose topics.

**snapshots** — GetDX snapshot generation (quarterly intervals).

**scenario** — Time-bounded effects on teams (commit volume, DX driver
trajectories, evidence generation).

**framework** — Full pathway framework: levels, capabilities with skills,
behaviours, disciplines with skill tiers, tracks, drivers, and stages.

**content** — Output content blocks specifying article/blog/FAQ counts, persona
configurations, and briefing counts.

## Data Resolution

This monorepo's universe DSL is `examples/universe.dsl`. Use `--universe=path`
to specify a different file. Without `--universe`, the CLI falls back to the
minimal reference DSL bundled with the package.

Generated output writes to `data/` directories at the monorepo root:

| Type       | Output Directory |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| `html`     | `data/knowledge` |
| `pathway`  | `data/pathway`   |
| `raw`      | `data/activity`  |
| `markdown` | `data/personal`  |

---

## Prose Cache

The prose cache is stored at `libraries/libuniverse/.prose-cache.json`. This
file is pre-populated for the BioNova universe (440+ keys). The default mode
reads from it without LLM calls.

When using `--generate`, new prose is appended to the cache after generation
completes. Subsequent default runs will reuse all generated content.

---

## Dataset Blocks

The universe DSL may include `dataset` and `output` blocks that use external
tools (Synthea, SDV, Faker). Unavailable tools are automatically skipped with an
info log — the pipeline continues and writes all other generated files normally.

Tool availability:

| Tool    | Requirement         | Always available? |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Faker   | Built-in (pure JS)  | Yes               |
| Synthea | Java + JAR file     | No                |
| SDV     | Python + sdv module | No                |

**Note:** The `--only` flag gates which render types execute (html, pathway,
raw, markdown). It does **not** affect dataset generation — datasets run when
present in the DSL but skip gracefully if the tool is unavailable.

---

## Environment

Generation requires `LLM_TOKEN` and `LLM_BASE_URL` when using `--generate` mode.
Load environment via `scripts/env.sh`:

```sh
ENV=local STORAGE=local AUTH=none ./scripts/env.sh npx fit-universe --generate
```

Or use the Makefile's env loading for consistency. `LLM_TOKEN` is always
available in the standard environment (see CLAUDE.md).

---

## Logging

Set `DEBUG=universe` for verbose debug output during generation. Operational
progress is logged to stderr via libtelemetry Logger (RFC 5424 format with
timestamps). Stdout is reserved for file counts, validation results, and prose
cache statistics.

---

## Feeding Generated Content to Guide

After generation, bootstrap the full Guide pipeline:

```sh
make quickstart       # Generates, copies to data/knowledge/, processes all resources
make rc-start         # Start services
```

Or run individual steps:

```sh
make data-init              # Creates data directories
make process-resources      # Create resource index from knowledge files
make process-graphs         # Build RDF graph from resources
make process-vectors        # Generate vector embeddings (requires TEI)
```

## Verification

After generation, the CLI runs cross-content validation automatically and
reports pass/fail for each check. Validate the generated pathway data
separately:

```sh
npx fit-map validate
```
