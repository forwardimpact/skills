  Prove whether a skill-pack change made agents better at writing code.
  Use when a single passing eval doesn't prove anything and you need
  multi-run pass@k evidence, when grading coding tasks with hidden tests
  the agent cannot see, or when comparing outcomes across skill-set
  versions.

# fit-benchmark

`fit-benchmark` answers one question Platform Builders care about: did our
skills (the `fit-*` / `kata-*` packs) make agents better at writing code?
A single agent run is a coin flip; one passing eval doesn't prove anything.
`fit-benchmark` runs each coding task N times across a skill-set
manifest, grades each run against tests that never enter the agent's
working directory, and reports pass@k using the OpenAI HumanEval
unbiased estimator.

## Why a Separate Tool

`fit-eval` is the generic agent-evaluation plumbing. `fit-benchmark` is
the opinionated layer on top — a task-family format, hidden invariant checks,
post-hoc judge, and multi-run aggregation. Keeping the two separate
keeps `fit-eval` low-level while letting the benchmark layer evolve.

## Task Family Format

A task family is a directory of related coding tasks plus the skill-set
under test:

```
<family>/
  apm.yml                # optional — skill-pack dependencies
  apm.lock.yaml          # skill-set manifest (hashed into skillSetHash)
  .env / .env.local      # env vars — loaded + rendered into each agent CWD
  .claude/               # pre-staged skills + agent profiles
  tasks/<task-name>/
    agent.task.md         # agent prompt (required)
    .env / .env.local     # task env vars — loaded + rendered (gitignored)
    supervisor.task.md    # optional — supervisor context for the relay
    judge.task.md         # optional — judge prompt (see § Judge Template Variables)
    hooks/preflight.sh    # optional — smoke probe; exit 0 confirms scaffold
    hooks/invariants.sh   # optional — fd 3 = $RESULTS_FD for structured rows
    specs/                # copied into agent CWD
    workdir/              # copied into agent CWD
```

Task IDs are directory names under `tasks/`. Local paths and git URLs
are both accepted.

## Environment Variables

The harness auto-discovers `.env` and `.env.local` in the family root
and each task directory, loads them into `process.env`, and renders the
merged result into the agent CWD before `preflight.sh`. `process.env`
always wins. Locally, use `.env.local` (gitignored). In CI, set secrets
as env vars. All discovered var names are added to the redaction allowlist.

## Lifecycle

For each `(task, runIndex)` the harness drives:

1. **Setup** — copy `workdir/`, `specs/`, and the staged `.claude/` into a
   fresh per-task CWD. Allocate a free TCP port. Run `hooks/preflight.sh`.
2. **Agent** — run the coding agent on `agent.task.md` with a default
   tool allow-list (`Bash`, `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Write`, `Edit`,
   `Agent`, `TodoWrite`). Override with `--allowed-tools`.
3. **Invariants** — run `hooks/invariants.sh` from the template path. The
   exit code is authoritative for the verdict; fd 3 (`$RESULTS_FD=3`)
   carries optional NDJSON rows for diagnostic per-check details.
4. **Judge** — a separate session reads the invariants outcome and the
   agent trace and calls `Conclude` with `success` or `failure`.
5. **Teardown** — SIGTERM/SIGKILL the per-task process group, verify
   the port is free, and reap descendants.

## CLI

Install and run via npm:

```sh
npx fit-benchmark <command> [options]
```

The full flag surface lives in [references/cli.md](references/cli.md).

## GitHub Action

The `forwardimpact/fit-benchmark@v1` composite action wraps the CLI for
GitHub Actions workflows. It installs dependencies, runs the benchmark,
appends the report to the step summary, and uploads `results.jsonl` as
a workflow artifact.

```yaml
- uses: forwardimpact/fit-benchmark@v1
  with:
    family: ./benchmarks/my-family
    runs: "5"
    judge-profile: judge
```

All CLI `run` flags are exposed as action inputs. Additional
CI-specific inputs:

| Input | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | `"true"` | Append text report to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` |
| `upload-results` | `"true"` | Upload `results.jsonl` as a workflow artifact |
| `artifact-name` | `"benchmark-results"` | Name for the uploaded artifact |
| `timeout-minutes` | `"60"` | Maximum minutes before cancellation |
| `k` | `"1,3,5"` | Comma-separated k values for the report |
| `format` | `"text"` | Report format (`json` or `text`) |

The action outputs `results-path` — the absolute path to
`results.jsonl` — for downstream steps.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `run` | Run every task N times against a family; append result records to `<output>/results.jsonl`. |
| `invariants` | Check a single task's invariants against a post-run workdir without invoking an agent. |
| `report` | Aggregate `results.jsonl` into pass@k, invariant checks, judge commentary, and operational stats. |

## Typical Workflow

```sh
# 1. Run the family. One ResultRecord streams to stdout per (task, run).
npx fit-benchmark run \
  --family=./families/coding \
  --agent-profile=coder \
  --judge-profile=judge

# 2. Aggregate into pass@k.
npx fit-benchmark report --format=text
```

## Judge Template Variables

The `judge.task.md` template supports these variables:

| Variable | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `{{AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS}}` | Contents of `agent.task.md` |
| `{{AGENT_PROFILE}}` | Agent profile body (empty string if none) |
| `{{AGENT_TRACE_PATH}}` | Path to `agent.ndjson` |
| `{{INVARIANTS_RESULT}}` | JSON invariants object (verdict, details, exitCode) |
| `{{SKILL_SET_HASH}}` | SHA-256 fingerprint from `apm.lock.yaml` |
| `{{TASK_ID}}` | Task name (directory under `tasks/`) |
| `{{TASK_DIR}}` | Agent working directory path |

## Grading Surfaces

`hooks/invariants.sh` decides "pass" or "fail" using any of three surfaces:

| Surface | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Running service** | HTTP-probe `http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/` and assert the response shape. |
| **Repository state** | Assert the SHA-256 of `$WORKDIR/result.txt`. |
| **Process exit** | Run a command in `$WORKDIR` and treat exit-zero as pass. |

The exit code of `invariants.sh` is the verdict. Rows written to `fd 3` (i.e.
`$RESULTS_FD`) are surfaced on the result record as `invariants.details[]`
for diagnostic breakdowns.

## Result Records

One record per `(taskId, runIndex)`, appended one per line to
`<output>/results.jsonl`. Each record validates against a single
declared schema (see [`benchmark/result.js`](https://github.com/forwardimpact/monorepo/blob/main/libraries/libeval/src/benchmark/result.js)).
Records carry the skill-set hash, the family revision, the post-hoc judge
verdict, the absolute trace paths, the cost, the turn count, and (on
pre-flight failure) a `preflightError` describing why the scaffold
didn't boot.

## Handing Off to `fit-trace`

Each run produces two NDJSON traces — one for the agent under test and
one for the judge session. Both are consumable by `fit-trace overview`
for post-hoc analysis.
